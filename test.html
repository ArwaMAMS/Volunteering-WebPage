<h1>Volunteering</h1>
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p class="h2">Volunteering is a voluntary act of an individual or group freely giving time and labour for community service.<br/>
Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue.<br/>
Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster.

<div><h2>Why volunteer?</h2>
<p> Volunteering can help you make friends, learn new skills, advance your career, and even feel happier and healthier.<br/>
With busy lives, it can be hard to find time to volunteer. However, the benefits of volunteering can be enormous.<br/> 
Volunteering offers vital help to people in need, worthwhile causes, and the community, but the benefits can be even greater for you, the volunteer.<br/> 
The right match can help you to find friends, connect with the community, learn new skills, and even advance your career.<br/>
Giving to others can also help protect your mental and physical health. It can reduce stress, combat depression, keep you mentally stimulated, and provide a sense of purpose.<br/>
While it’s true that the more you volunteer, the more benefits you’ll experience, volunteering doesn’t have to involve<br/>
 a long-term commitment or take a huge amount of time out of your busy day. 
Giving in even simple ways can help those in need and improve your health and happiness.</p></div><br/><br/>

<div><h2>How to find the right volunteer opportunity?</h2>
<p>There are numerous volunteer opportunities available. The key is to find a position that you would enjoy and are capable of doing.<br/> 
It’s also important to make sure that your commitment matches the organization’s needs. Ask yourself the following:</p>
<br/>
<!--Make a List -->
<ul>
<li>Would you like to work with adults, children, animals, or remotely from home?</li>
<li>Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team?</li>
<li>Are you better behind the scenes or do you prefer to take a more visible role?</li>
<li>How much time are you willing to commit?</li>
<li>What skills can you bring to a volunteer job?</li>
<li>What causes are important to you?</li>
</ul></div><br/><br/>

<div><h2>Getting the most out of volunteering</h2>
<p>You’re donating your valuable time, so it’s important that you enjoy and benefit
<br/> from your volunteering. 
To make sure that your volunteer position is a good fit:</p>
<br/>
<!--Make a Definition Lists -->
<dl>
<b><dt> Ask questions.</dt></b>
<dd> You want to make sure that the experience is right for your skills, your goals, and the time you want to spend.<br/> 
Sample questions for your volunteer coordinator might address your time commitment, if there’s any training involved,<br/>
who you will be working with, and what to do if you have questions during your experience. </dd><br/>
<b><dt> Make sure you know what’s expected. </dt></b>
<dd>You should be comfortable with the organization and understand the time commitment.<br/>
 Consider starting small so that you don’t over commit yourself at first. Give yourself some flexibility to change your focus if needed.</dd><br/>
<b><dt> Enjoy yourself. </dt></b>
<dd>The best volunteer experiences benefit both the volunteer and the organization.<br/>
 If you’re not enjoying yourself, ask yourself why. Is it the tasks you’re performing? The people you’re working with?<br/>
 Or are you uncomfortable simply because the situation is new and unfamiliar? Pinpointing what’s bothering you can help you decide how to proceed.</dd><br/>
